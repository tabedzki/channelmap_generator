# Summary

PixelMap is a browser-based application for designing custom channelmaps for Neuropixels probes while respecting electrode wiring constraints. Neuropixels probes, widely used for high-density neural recordings, have more physical electrodes than can be used for simultaneous recording because they contain fewer readout channels and analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs) than electrodes. Each ADC and readout channel is hard-wired to several electrodes, creating complex interdependencies where selecting one electrode makes others unavailable. PixelMap provides an installation-free, browser-based interface for researchers to design arbitrary recording configurations that meet their experimental requirements while satisfying these hardware constraints. Beyond constraint-aware electrode selection, PixelMap supports two guided workflows: overlaying anatomical region boundaries from any BrainGlobe atlas to plan recordings around specific regions, and overlaying a SpikeGLX activity survey heatmap to identify the most active channels after implantation. Both overlays can be used simultaneously during electrode selection. PixelMap generates IMRO (IMEC Read Out) files compatible with SpikeGLX, the reference acquisition software for Neuropixels recordings.

# Statement of need

Neuropixels probes have revolutionised systems neuroscience by enabling simultaneous recordings from hundreds of neurons across multiple brain regions at any depth [@jun2017; @beau2021; @steinmetz2021; @bondy2024; @ye2025; @beau2025]. However, configuring these probes presents challenges. Limited by the number of readout channels and integrated ADCs, Neuropixels probes contain 960–5,120 physical electrodes per probe but only 384–1,536 readout channels, and can therefore record from at most that many electrodes simultaneously (Table 1). Thus users must select a subset of electrodes to activate for each recording, forming an electrode selection set colloquially called a "channelmap".

Because readout lines within each shank and ADCs in the probe head are each shared by multiple physical electrodes, activating one electrode makes others unavailable. For Neuropixels 1.0, these dependencies follow a regular, bank-aligned pattern that is relatively intuitive. With single-shank Neuropixels 2.0 probes [@steinmetz2021], whose wiring is intentionally scrambled to enable recording from several banks simultaneously, and four-shank Neuropixels 2.0 probes, whose wiring becomes intractable to reason about given the high number of electrode banks, the inter-electrode incompatibilities become difficult to anticipate.

Beyond satisfying hardware constraints, channelmaps must be tailored to the experiment. Before implantation, researchers plan which brain regions each probe will traverse given its intended insertion trajectory; this requires mapping anatomical boundaries onto the physical electrode layout. After implantation (chronic or acute), researchers must adjust their channelmap based on observed neural activity. Regions with large waveforms typically correspond to grey matter (rich in axon initial segments), marking target region entry and exit points. The typical workflow is therefore: plan anatomically before implantation, survey activity afterwards, and refine the channelmap to maximise unit yield in the target regions. Using multiple probes simultaneously, where the difficulty compounds, is becoming commonplace [@bondy2024], making a fast wiring-aware design tool increasingly essential. Developing a tool to support this workflow within the Brody laboratory motivated the creation of PixelMap, which addresses these needs by:

1. **Being available on any machine installation-free** at [https://pixelmap.pni.princeton.edu](https://pixelmap.pni.princeton.edu).
2. **Visualising wiring constraints in real time**: When users select electrodes (red), the interface immediately shows which become unavailable (black) due to shared lines or ADCs, preventing invalid configurations.
3. **Supporting arbitrary electrode geometries** through 1) common preset geometries, 2) entering electrode ranges as text for reproducibility, 3) directly clicking or dragging on the probe visualisation, or 4) loading pre-existing `.imro` files. These four selection methods are compatible with one another and meant to be combined.
4. **Guiding channelmap design with anatomy and activity overlays**: Users can overlay anatomical region boundaries from any brain atlas available through BrainGlobe [@claudi2020] to plan recordings around specific brain regions of interest, and **simultaneously** a SpikeGLX activity survey heatmap to identify the most active channels and confirm anatomical predictions after probe implantation.

| Probe Version | Physical Electrodes | Readout Channels |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Neuropixels 1.0 | 960 | 384 |
| Neuropixels 2.0 (single shank) | 1,280 | 384 |
| Neuropixels 2.0 (4-shank) | 5,120 (1,280 per shank) | 384 |
| Neuropixels 2.0 Quad Base | 5,120 (1,280 per shank) | 1,536 (384 max per shank) |

**Table 1**: Number of physical electrodes and readout channels across the Neuropixels probe versions supported by PixelMap. Each readout channel digitises a single electrode at a time, so the number of readout channels sets how many electrodes can be recorded from simultaneously.

# State of the Field

SpikeGLX ([https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX](https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX)) and Open Ephys ([Neuropixels-PXI plugin](https://open-ephys.github.io/gui-docs/User-Manual/Plugins/Neuropixels-PXI.html)), the two most widely used systems for acquiring Neuropixels data, allow channelmap editing but their primary purpose is to enable reliable data acquisition. Both prioritise stable high-throughput data streaming and visualisation; channelmap editing is a configuration step performed at the rig on the machine connected to the probe, optimised for fast on-the-fly setup at recording time. SpikeGLX's editor is also the field's authoritative reference for wiring constraints, obtained directly from the manufacturer (IMEC); for this reason, PixelMap derives its information from SpikeGLX and writes channelmaps as `.imro` files compatible with SpikeGLX. NeuroCarto [@su2025], a recently published browser-based editor that runs locally, offers a GUI that is built around a novel automated channelmap-generation algorithm: the user specifies a target electrode density for each region along the shank, and a channelmap meeting those constraints is generated.

PixelMap, by contrast, is built as a no-install generalist design tool. It brings together in a single tool the features distributed across the solutions above (real-time visualisation of wiring constraints, `.imro` output, an interactive click-and-drag editor, anatomical reference) and adds several capabilities not available elsewhere:

- PixelMap is the only solution that requires no installation, hosted at [https://pixelmap.pni.princeton.edu](https://pixelmap.pni.princeton.edu), so a channelmap can be built on any machine without desktop acquisition software or a connected probe.
- Probe support follows the authoritative reference. Probe-group and subgroup definitions, which alter `.imro` file formats, are derived from SpikeGLX's [IMRO table documentation](https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/help/imroTables). This guarantees present accuracy and forward compatibility.
- The full probe-dependent `.imro` metadata is exposed, including the Neuropixels 1.0 hardware filter, gain settings, and electrode reference (external, tip, or join-tips).
- A wider set of arbitrary geometries can be selected. Beyond custom presets, text entry of electrode ranges, and an `.imro` loader, it provides single-click and five drag-box tools, including interleaved and checkerboard selectors for broader coverage, and a "deselect dependents" box, unavailable elsewhere, that releases selected electrodes blocking a target region.
- The anatomical overlay is built on the BrainGlobe Atlas API [@claudi2020], which makes any BrainGlobe atlas available immediately. PixelMap renders the region each electrode traverses beside the probe.
- An activity overlay based on a SpikeGLX survey can be displayed simultaneously with the anatomical overlay while electrode selection remains available, which is particularly helpful for experiment planning and is not offered by any currently available software.

# Software Design

PixelMap is implemented in Python and consists of three main components:

- The **probe type database and wiring maps** (distributed in `./constants.py`, `./utils/probe_features.py`, `./wiring_maps/*`) derives the mapping between probe part numbers, SpikeGLX probe types, and IMRO format numbers directly from SpikeGLX's authoritative [IMRO table documentation](https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/help/imroTables). The **wiring maps** at `./wiring_maps/*.csv` are CSV files describing the electrode-to-ADC mappings for each supported probe type. They were adapted from files provided by IMEC, the Neuropixels manufacturer (downloadable from the [Neuropixels support page](https://www.neuropixels.org/support)), and by [SpikeGLX](https://github.com/billkarsh/SpikeGLX/tree/a9024ba79f4481883766f5468563accb74fd58fd/Src-imro).
- The **electrode selection logic** at `./backend.py` implements the constraint-checking algorithms that validate electrode selections against probe-specific wiring maps. Incompatible electrode pairs are cached in hash tables (Python dictionaries), so constraint queries run in O(1) and the interface stays responsive.
- The **graphical user interface** at `./gui/gui.py` was built with HoloViz Panel. User interactions trigger immediate recalculation of available electrodes, ensuring users receive instant visual feedback about constraint violations. The **activity survey overlay** reads a tab-separated file exported from SpikeGLX (one row per electrode, with columns `Shank`, `Xum`, `Zum`, `Val`) and renders a coloured bar beside each electrode. The **anatomical overlay** computes the brain region traversed by each electrode along a user-specified insertion trajectory—accounting for pitch, yaw, and multi-shank orientation—using any atlas registered in the BrainGlobe atlas API [@claudi2020]. The two most widely used atlases (Allen Mouse 25 µm `allen_mouse_25um` and Waxholm rat 39 µm `whs_sd_rat_39um`) are pre-downloaded so they are available instantly. Additional atlases are downloaded on demand and stored in a shared Docker volume (`brainglobe_cache`) that persists across users.

## Forward Compatibility and Extensibility

PixelMap's architecture is designed to easily support future hardware and atlases, lowering the barrier for both maintainers and contributors.

**Probe support.** Wiring constraints are encoded as standalone CSV files (`wiring_maps/*.csv`), one per probe type, and probe metadata (part numbers, readout counts, electrode pitches) is derived directly from the authoritative JSON maintained by SpikeGLX developer Bill Karsh.

**Atlas support.** As the anatomical overlay is built on the BrainGlobe Atlas API [@claudi2020], any atlas registered with BrainGlobe in the future will be automatically available to PixelMap users without code changes.

**Contributor extensibility.** The codebase is written as comprehensively as possible with contributions in mind. New selection presets can be added to `backend.py`, new overlay types can follow the pattern established by the activity-survey and anatomy overlays, and the GUI layer can be extended or replaced without modifying the core constraint logic. This modular design, together with comprehensive tests and a [contributor guide](https://pixelmap-neuropixels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html), is intended to make contribution straightforward. These design choices have already enabled two new contributors to add significant features in 2026, warranting authorship on this paper: the anatomical overlay (J.M.J.F.) and the activity survey overlay (J.Y.).

![PixelMap's browser-based graphical user interface, shown here for a four-shank Neuropixels 2.0 probe.\
**Left:** *Probe and recording metadata* panel (these metadata are also written into `.imro` files), followed by three of the four methods of electrode selection: *Preset Selection* (preset geometries), *Textual Selection* (manual input of electrode ranges), and *Selection from IMRO file* (pre-loading an existing `.imro` file). These three methods can be mixed with each other and with the five interactive click-and-drag box tools, whose toolbar sits along the right edge of the central panel. Controls for the activity survey and anatomical overlays are further down this panel, below the cropped view.\
**Centre:** main panel featuring the probe's physical layout with one or four shanks that exhibit the 960 (Neuropixels 1.0) or 1,280 (Neuropixels 2.0, Quad Base) physical electrodes per shank to be selected from. Electrodes available for selection are light grey, selected electrodes turn red, and electrodes that become unavailable due to hardware wiring constraints turn black. In this example, 384 electrodes have been selected (matching the maximum simultaneous recording capacity of this probe), with a pattern distributed across multiple banks and shanks, illustrating that PixelMap allows selection of arbitrary channelmap geometries. The optional anatomical overlay, which guides channelmap design, is rendered beside the shanks as coloured depth bands with region labels.\
**Right:** electrode status indicator that turns green to confirm the selection is complete and is ready for IMRO file generation, above undo, redo and clear-selection controls. Under *Export IMRO table*, users name their file and export their configuration with the "IMRO" button for direct use in SpikeGLX, optionally alongside a "PDF" visualisation to easily remember the geometry of the corresponding `.imro` file in the future, and a "Kilosort" channelmap for subsequent spike sorting. *Share this layout* encodes the current selection into a shareable link, and *Anatomical overlay* displays the insertion trajectory on sagittal, coronal and horizontal atlas sections together with a legend of the traversed regions.

# Research Impact Statement

PixelMap addresses a practical bottleneck in Neuropixels experimental workflows. Neuropixels probes have become the dominant technology for large-scale electrophysiology, with exponential growth in publications using the technology ([PubMed](https://esperr.github.io/pubmed-by-year/?q1=Neuropixels)). Yet no existing tool provides installation-free channelmap design with support for arbitrary electrode geometries and simultaneous anatomy- and activity-guided planning (see **State of the Field**).

PixelMap is released under an open-source licence (GPLv3), provides comprehensive documentation including a [contributor guide](https://pixelmap-neuropixels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html), and is accessible via web application, Python package, Docker container, or programmatic API. It builds on the authors' track record using Neuropixels probes [@steinmetz2021; @bondy2024; @beau2025; @fabre2026basal] and developing Neuropixels software [@beau2021].

Adoption is evidenced by deployment on PNI's public server, 59 GitHub stars, and web traffic of roughly 400 unique visitors between March and May 2026 (~45/week; see the [analytics](https://github.com/m-beau/pixelmap/tree/main/analytics) folder of the repository). The package has been under active development for over ten months, with external contributors implementing new features (anatomical and activity overlays).

# Pre-download the common mouse and rat atlases, plus the registry index, so
# the running container never has to reach the atlas host.  Under
# brainglobe-atlasapi v3 both atlases together are only ~9 MB of compressed
# OME-Zarr, so this is cheap.
#
# NOT best-effort: prefetch_atlases.py exits non-zero if it cannot warm the
# cache, failing the build.  A cold image is what took the server down in
# v1.2.x -- it pushes the download into the single-threaded Bokeh process at
# runtime.  See the script's docstring for the full story.

# the image baked in -- and a single deploy of a cold image leaves a cold
# volume that shadows every later image, warm or not.  entrypoint.sh copies
# anything missing out of this seed at startup, which makes that trap
# impossible regardless of the volume's history.

"""Thin wrapper around ``brainglobe-atlasapi`` for PixelMap.

Why a wrapper:

* Cache atlas instances per-process so repeated lookups don't re-read the
  atlas metadata, and hold the decompressed annotation volumes (hundreds of
  MB to several GB each) in one byte-bounded cache -- see "Who owns the
  annotation volumes" below.
* Expose a tiny ``RegionInfo`` record so the rest of PixelMap doesn't
  depend on brainglobe's object model.
* Keep every network call off the caller's thread, because on the hosted
  server that thread is the one serving every other user (see below).

Requires brainglobe-atlasapi >= 3
---------------------------------
v3 rewrote how atlases live on disk: OME-Zarr on S3 rather than tiff bundles
on GIN, components shared between atlases, stored under
``~/.brainglobe/brainglobe-atlasapi/``.  PixelMap requires it, and v2 is not
supported.  Two properties of that layout shape the code below:

* Array data is fetched **lazily**, on first attribute access rather than at
  construction.  So "the atlas is downloaded" and "reading the annotation is
  free" are different questions, and :func:`is_downloaded` — which callers use
  to decide whether an action is cheap — answers the second one.  Metadata-only
  queries (shape, resolution) must therefore avoid touching ``annotation``, or
  they would trigger the very download they exist to let the caller skip.
* Atlases are small on disk: allen_mouse_25um and whs_sd_rat_39um together are
  ~9 MB of compressed chunks, against ~1.3 GB of tiffs under v2.  That is what
  makes baking them into the Docker image cheap and reliable.

Who owns the annotation volumes
-------------------------------
Exactly one thing: :data:`_VOLUMES`, a byte-budgeted LRU keyed by atlas name,
read through :func:`canonical_annotation`.  Everything else holds volumes only
transiently.  This is deliberate, and worth defending:

* An ``lru_cache`` counts *entries*, not bytes.  ``maxsize=4`` is four
  38 MB atlases or four 4.8 GB ones (allen_mouse_10um), so it never related to
  the container's memory limit.  The budget here is in bytes and defaults to
  half the cgroup limit (``PIXELMAP_ATLAS_CACHE_MB`` overrides it).
* Two caches with independent LRU orders leak.  ``get_atlas`` and the old
  ``canonical_annotation`` each evicted on their own schedule; once one dropped
  an atlas the other still pinned its array (a transposed *view* keeps the
  base alive), and the next ``ensure_downloaded`` loaded a second copy.
  brainglobe also caches the array on the atlas object itself, so
  :func:`_take_annotation` detaches it and ``get_atlas`` only ever holds
  cheap metadata objects.
* Dropping a reference is not freeing memory.  glibc keeps freed pages in its
  arenas -- after clearing every cache the process still sat at 1.2 GB RSS
  until ``malloc_trim``.  The container limit counts RSS, so every eviction
  and every load ends with :func:`_memory.release_freed_memory`.

Why the network never runs inline
---------------------------------
The deployed app is a single-process Panel/Bokeh server: a blocking call on
its event loop stalls *every* connected user and the container healthcheck.
brainglobe's registry fetch uses ``requests.get`` with no timeout, so a
hosting outage used to hang the server rather than degrade it.  Hence
:func:`list_atlases` answers from disk or from a bundled snapshot and refreshes
in a daemon thread, and :func:`ensure_downloaded` exists so the GUI can move
the one genuinely expensive call onto a worker thread.

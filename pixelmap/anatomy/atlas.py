"""Thin wrapper around ``brainglobe-atlasapi`` for PixelMap.

Why a wrapper:

* Cache atlas instances per-process so repeated lookups don't re-load the
  annotation volume (hundreds of MB once decompressed).
* Expose a tiny ``RegionInfo`` record so the rest of PixelMap doesn't
  depend on brainglobe's object model.
* Keep every network call off the caller's thread, because on the hosted
  server that thread is the one serving every other user (see below).

Requires brainglobe-atlasapi >= 3
---------------------------------
v3 rewrote how atlases live on disk: OME-Zarr on S3 rather than tiff bundles
on GIN, components shared between atlases, stored under
``~/.brainglobe/brainglobe-atlasapi/``.  PixelMap requires it, and v2 is not
supported.  Two properties of that layout shape the code below:

* Array data is fetched **lazily**, on first attribute access rather than at
  construction.  So "the atlas is downloaded" and "reading the annotation is
  free" are different questions, and :func:`is_downloaded` — which callers use
  to decide whether an action is cheap — answers the second one.  Metadata-only
  queries (shape, resolution) must therefore avoid touching ``annotation``, or
  they would trigger the very download they exist to let the caller skip.
* Atlases are small on disk: allen_mouse_25um and whs_sd_rat_39um together are
  ~9 MB of compressed chunks, against ~1.3 GB of tiffs under v2.  That is what
  makes baking them into the Docker image cheap and reliable.
* brainglobe decodes ``annotation`` through dask (``.data.compute()``), which
  holds every decompressed chunk *and* the assembled array at once: the
  1.07 GB rat volume peaks at +2.1 GB RSS, and a 4.8 GB 10 µm volume would
  need ~10 GB.  :func:`load_annotation` reads the same chunks straight through
  zarr into one preallocated array instead (peak ≈ the array itself, and about
  twice as fast), so nothing here goes through ``atlas.annotation``.

Why the network never runs inline
---------------------------------
The deployed app is a single-process Panel/Bokeh server: a blocking call on
its event loop stalls *every* connected user and the container healthcheck.
brainglobe's registry fetch uses ``requests.get`` with no timeout, so a
hosting outage used to hang the server rather than degrade it.  Hence
:func:`list_atlases` answers from disk or from a bundled snapshot and refreshes
in a daemon thread, and :func:`ensure_downloaded` exists so the GUI can move
the one genuinely expensive call onto a worker thread.

# PixelMap

**A browser-based GUI to generate Neuropixels channelmaps that respect electrode-ADC wiring constraints.**

PixelMap lets you design custom [IMRO tables](https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/help/imroTables/) for SpikeGLX — the files that control which electrodes to record from on Neuropixels probes. It enforces the hardware wiring constraints that make manual IMRO editing error-prone.
